A durable atom type for Clojure. Duratom implements the same interfaces as the core Clojure atom (IAtom, IRef, IDeref), plus the `IDurable` protocol from `duratom.core`.
In order to provide durability `duratom` will persist its state to some durable-backend on each mutation. The built-in backends are:
 
 1. A file on the local file-system
 2. A postgres DB table

Note: Several ideas taken/adapted/combined from [enduro](https://github.com/alandipert/enduro) & [durable-atom](https://github.com/polygloton/durable-atom)

Main difference between `duratom` & `enduro` is that an `enduro` atom is not a drop-in replacement for regular clojure atoms. In particular:
  
  1. it doesn't implement all the same interfaces as regular clojure atoms (as of Clojure 1.8). As a result it comes with its own `swap!` & `reset!` implementations.
  2. it requires the watches/validators to be provided in atoms upon construction.  

Main difference between `duratom` & `durable-atom` is that a `durable-atom` atom doesn't have a second level of polymorphism to accommodate for switching storage backends. It assumes that a file-backed atom is always what you want. Moreover, it uses `slurp` & `spit` for reading/writing to the disk, which, in practice, puts a limit on how big data-structures you can fit in a String (depending on your hardware & JVM configuration of course). 

## Usage
The public API consists of a single constructor function (`duratom.core/duratom`). Once you have constructed a duratom object, you can use it just like a regular atom,
with the slight addition that when you're done with it, you can call `duratom.core/destroy` on it to clear the durable backend (e.g. delete the file/table). 
Subsequent mutating operations are prohibited (only `deref`ing will work).

###Example

```clj

;; backed by file
(duratom :local-file 
         :file-path "/home/dimitris/Desktop/data.txt"
         :init {:x 1 :y 2})
         
;; backed by postgres-db
(duratom :postgres-db 
         :db-config "any-db-spec-understood-by-clojure.java.jdbc"
         :table-name "my_table"
         :init {:x 1 :y 2})          
```

The initial-value <init> is ignored, unless the underlying persistent storage is found to be empty.
If you prefer passing arguments positionally, you can use the `file-atom` & `postgres-atom` equivalents.
